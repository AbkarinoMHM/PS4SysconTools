    /// .NET Framework uses <see cref="System.Diagnostics.TraceSource"/> which reads the application configuration file
    /// and instantiates the logging infrastructure, which is a static instance. Since .NET Core, this doesn't work and
    /// the alternative method is to instantiate the objects through dependency injection. People upgrading or
    /// supporting multiple frameworks (.NET Framework and .NET Core) have to provide a lot of effort in separating the
    /// two. This library makes it easier by optionally providing the logger factory as a static instance to this class.
    /// <para>Note, reading configuration files, is still the responsibility of the client application. Refer to the
