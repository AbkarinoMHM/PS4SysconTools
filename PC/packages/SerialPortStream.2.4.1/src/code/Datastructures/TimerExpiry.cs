    /// A class to maintain how much time is remaining since the last reset, until
    /// expiry.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// This class is useful when implementing time outs in other methods. It can
    /// provide the remaining time, in units of milliseconds, that can be used
    /// with many Operating System calls as an expiry time.
    /// <para>One example is the <see cref="M:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitOne"/>
    /// method which expects a time out parameter. Either instantiate the
    /// <see cref="TimerExpiry"/> class at the beginning immediately before its
    /// use, or call the <see cref="Reset"/> method at the beginning
    /// of the time out operation. Then on return of the function, if no other
    /// operation occurred, the method <see cref="RemainingTime"/> should return 0 indicating
    /// that the timer has expired.</para>
    /// <para>Another thread can be programmed to <see cref="Reset"/> the timer class during
    /// a time out operation, so that even if the result of Wait operation by the
    /// Operating system resulted in a time out, a <see cref="Reset"/>, which results in the
    /// <see cref="RemainingTime"/> being more than 0 milliseconds, indicates that another
    /// wait operation should occur.</para>
    /// <para>Even if no expiry is to occur, but the Operating System function
    /// returns early, you can opt to restart the time out operation which will
    /// then take into account the current time and reduce the time out so that
    /// the operation ends as expected.</para>
    /// <para>As an example, say you need to wait for data by calling a method which waits
    /// for the first set of data within a time out. But your method must wait for at least
    /// two elements of data within the time out. This can be implemented as follows:</para>
    /// <example>
    /// public bool MyFunc(int timeOut)
    /// {
    ///     TimerExpiry myExpiry = new TimerExpiry(timeOut);
    ///     int elements = 0;
    ///     do {
    ///         elements += GetData(myExpiry.RemainingTime());
    ///     } while (elements &lt; 2 &amp;&amp; !myExpiry.Expired);
    ///
    ///     if (elements &gt;=2) return true;
    ///     return false;
    /// }
    /// </example>
