            <summary>
            A simple data structure to manage an array as a circular buffer.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This class provides simple methods for abstracting a circular buffer. A circular buffer allows for faster access
            of data by avoiding potential copy operations for data that is at the beginning.
            <para>
            Stream data structures can benefit from this data structure by allocating a single block on the heap of an
            arbitrary size. If the stream is long-lived the benefits are larger. In the .NET framework (4.0 and earlier),
            all allocations of data structures that are 80kb and larger are automatically allocated on the heap. The heap is
            not garbage collected like smaller objects. Instead, new elements are added to the heap in an incremental
            fashion. It is theoretically possible to exhaust all memory in an application by allocating and deallocating
            regularly on a heap if such a new heap element requires space and there is not a single block large enough. By
            using the <see cref="T:RJCP.Datastructures.CircularBuffer`1"/> with the type <c>T</c> as <c>byte</c>, you can preallocate a buffer
            for a stream of any reasonable size (as a simple example 5MB). That block is allocated once and remains for the
            lifetime of the stream. No time will be allocated for compacting or garbage collection.

            This method advances the internal pointers for <i>Start</i> based on the <i>length</i> that should be
            consumed. The pointer <i>End</i> does not change. It is important that this method does not <i>Reset()</i>
            the buffer in case that all data is consumed. A common scenario with Streams is to write into the buffer
            using asynchronous I/O. If a <i>Reset()</i> occurs during an asynchronous I/O <i>ReadFile()</i>, the
            <i>End</i> pointer is also changed, so that when a <i>Produce()</i> occurs on completion of the
            <i>ReadFile()</i> operation, the pointers are updated, but not using the pointers before the <i>Reset()</i>.
            No crash would occur (so long as the underlying array is pinned), but data corruption would occur if this
            method were not used in this particular scenario.

            When converting a sequence of bytes to multiple chars, if those sequences result in the minimum number of
            characters being written as 2 or more characters, slight discrepancies occur. A UTF8 decoder would convert
            the sequence F3 A0 82 84 to the two characters DB40 DC84. The UTF8 decoder would not consume any of the 4
            bytes if all 4 bytes are immediately available to a single call to the Decoder.Convert() function and
            instead raise an exception. This Convert() function may consume some of these bytes and indicate success, if
            the byte sequence wraps over from the end of the array to the beginning of the array. The number of bytes
            consumed (bytesUsed) is correct and characters produced (charsUsed) is also correct. There is no error found
            according to the MS documentation. The next call will result in an exception instead. So this function may:
            consume more bytes than expected (but with the correct results); and may not raise an exception immediately
            if those bytes were consumed.

             <summary>
             A class to maintain how much time is remaining since the last reset, until
             expiry.
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             This class is useful when implementing time outs in other methods. It can
             provide the remaining time, in units of milliseconds, that can be used
             with many Operating System calls as an expiry time.
             <para>One example is the <see cref="M:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitOne"/>
             method which expects a time out parameter. Either instantiate the
             <see cref="T:RJCP.Datastructures.TimerExpiry"/> class at the beginning immediately before its
             use, or call the <see cref="M:RJCP.Datastructures.TimerExpiry.Reset"/> method at the beginning
             of the time out operation. Then on return of the function, if no other
             operation occurred, the method <see cref="M:RJCP.Datastructures.TimerExpiry.RemainingTime"/> should return 0 indicating
             that the timer has expired.</para>
             <para>Another thread can be programmed to <see cref="M:RJCP.Datastructures.TimerExpiry.Reset"/> the timer class during
             a time out operation, so that even if the result of Wait operation by the
             Operating system resulted in a time out, a <see cref="M:RJCP.Datastructures.TimerExpiry.Reset"/>, which results in the
             <see cref="M:RJCP.Datastructures.TimerExpiry.RemainingTime"/> being more than 0 milliseconds, indicates that another
             wait operation should occur.</para>
             <para>Even if no expiry is to occur, but the Operating System function
             returns early, you can opt to restart the time out operation which will
             then take into account the current time and reduce the time out so that
             the operation ends as expected.</para>
             <para>As an example, say you need to wait for data by calling a method which waits
             for the first set of data within a time out. But your method must wait for at least
             two elements of data within the time out. This can be implemented as follows:</para>
             <example>
             public bool MyFunc(int timeOut)
             {
                 TimerExpiry myExpiry = new TimerExpiry(timeOut);
                 int elements = 0;
                 do {
                     elements += GetData(myExpiry.RemainingTime());
                 } while (elements &lt; 2 &amp;&amp; !myExpiry.Expired);
            
                 if (elements &gt;=2) return true;
                 return false;
             }

            driver itself are not accounted for, as they haven't yet been read by the local thread.
            <para>
            This has the effect, that if the local buffer is full (let's say that it is arbitrarily picked to be 64KB)
            and the local driver also has buffered 4KB, only the size of the local buffer is given, so 64KB (instead of
            the expected 68KB).

            The range of values for this property is from 5 through 8 and 16. A check is made by setting this property

            Not all possible combinations are allowed by all drivers. That implies, that an exception may be raised for

            Enables handshaking on the serial port. We support three types of handshaking: RTS/CTS; XON/XOFF; and

            This method is not 100% compatible with the Microsoft implementation. By disabling RTS flow control, it sets
            behaviour so that the RTS line is enabled. You must set the property <see cref="P:RJCP.IO.Ports.ISerialPortStream.RtsEnable"/> as appropriate.
            Although the Microsoft implementation doesn't support DSR/DTR at all, setting this property will also set
            the DTR line to enabled. You must set the property <see cref="P:RJCP.IO.Ports.ISerialPortStream.DtrEnable"/> as appropriate.

            When enabling DTR flow control, the DsrSensitivity flag is set, so the driver ignores any bytes received,

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            The ReadTo() function will read text from the byte buffer up to a predetermined limit (1024 characters) when
            looking for the string <paramref name="text"/>. If <paramref name="text"/> is not found within this limit,
            data is thrown away and more data is read (effectively consuming the earlier bytes).
            <para>
            This method is provided as compatibility with the Microsoft implementation. There are some important
            differences however. This method attempts to fix a minor pathological problem with the Microsoft
            implementation. If the string <paramref name="text"/> is not found, the MS implementation may modify the
            internal state of the decoder. As a workaround, it pushes all decoded characters back into its internal byte
            buffer, which fixes the problem that a second call to the ReadTo() method returns the consistent results,
            but a call to Read(byte[], ..) may return data that was not actually transmitted by the DCE. This would
            happen in case that an invalid byte sequence was found, converted to a fall back character. The original
            byte sequence is removed and replaced with the byte equivalent of the fall back character.
            </para>
            <para>This method is rather slow, because it tries to preserve the byte buffer in case of failure.</para>
            <para>
            In case the data cannot be read, an exception is always thrown. So you may assume that if this method
            returns, you have valid data.

            Reads all data in the current buffer. If there is no data available, then no data is returned. This is

            <para>
            Because this method returns only the data that is currently in the cached buffer and ignores the data that is
            actually buffered by the driver itself, there may be a slight discrepancy between the value returned by

            Data is copied from the array provided into the local stream buffer. It does not guarantee that data will be
            sent over the serial port. So long as there is enough local buffer space to accept the write of count bytes,
            this function will succeed. In case that the buffered serial stream doesn't have enough data, the function
            will wait up to <see cref="P:RJCP.IO.Ports.SerialPortStream.WriteTimeout"/> milliseconds for enough buffer data to become
            available. In case that there is not enough space before the write time out expires, no data is copied to
            the local stream and the function fails with an exception.
            <para>
            For reliability, this function will only write data to the write buffer if the complete set of data
            requested can be written. This implies that the parameter <paramref name="count"/> be less or equal to the
            number of bytes that are available in the write buffer. Equivalently, you must make sure that you have a
            write buffer with at least <paramref name="count"/> allocated bytes or this function will always raise an
            exception.

            This function abstracts the Win32 API WaitCommEvent(). It assumes overlapped I/O.
            Therefore, when calling this function, you should ensure that the parameter <c>mask</c>
            and <c>overlap</c> are pinned for the duration of the overlapped I/O. Any easy way to
            do this is to allocate the variables on the stack and then pass them by reference to
            this function.

            indicates that asynchronous I/O is happening, <b>true</b> is returned. Else this

            This function should be called if there is no existing pending write operation. If
            the result indicates that asynchronous I/O is happening, <b>true</b> is returned.
            Else this function automatically calls ProcessWriteEvent() with the number of bytes
            written. If an asynchronous operation is pending, then you should wait on the event
            in the overlapped structure not call this function until GetOverlappedResult()
            has been called.

            This implementation is a ground up reimplementation of the Microsoft SerialPort class

            Normally when you instantiate this stream on a COM port, it is opened for a brief time and queried for the
            capabilities and default settings. This allows your application to use the settings that were already
            available (such as defined by the windows user in the Control Panel, or the last open application). If you
            require to open the COM port without briefly opening it to query its status, then you need to instantiate
            this object through the default constructor. Set the property UpdateOnPortSet to <see langword="false"/> and
            then set the Port property. Provide all the other properties you require then call the <see cref="M:RJCP.IO.Ports.SerialPortStream.Open"/>

            You can override the open so that no communication settings are retrieved or set. This is useful for virtual

            <remarks>
            The ReadTo() function will read text from the byte buffer up to a predetermined limit (1024 characters) when
            looking for the string <paramref name="text"/>. If <paramref name="text"/> is not found within this limit,
            data is thrown away and more data is read (effectively consuming the earlier bytes).
            <para>
            This method is provided as compatibility with the Microsoft implementation. There are some important
            differences however. This method attempts to fix a minor pathological problem with the Microsoft
            implementation. If the string <paramref name="text"/> is not found, the MS implementation may modify the
            internal state of the decoder. As a workaround, it pushes all decoded characters back into its internal byte
            buffer, which fixes the problem that a second call to the ReadTo() method returns the consistent results,
            but a call to Read(byte[], ..) may return data that was not actually transmitted by the DCE. This would
            happen in case that an invalid byte sequence was found, converted to a fall back character. The original
            byte sequence is removed and replaced with the byte equivalent of the fall back character.
            </para>
            <para>This method is rather slow, because it tries to preserve the byte buffer in case of failure.</para>
            <para>
            In case the data cannot be read, an exception is always thrown. So you may assume that if this method

            <remarks>
            The stream doesn't impose any arbitrary limits on setting the baud rate. It is passed
            directly to the driver and it is up to the driver to determine if the baud rate is
            settable or not. Normally, a driver will attempt to set a baud rate that is within 5%
            of the requested baud rate (but not guaranteed).
            <para>If the serial driver doesn't support setting the baud rate, setting this property

            <remarks>
            The range of values for this property is from 5 through 8 and 16. A check is made by setting
            this property against the advertised capabilities of the driver. That is, a driver lists
            its capabilities to say what byte sizes it can support. If the driver cannot support the byte
            size requested, an exception is raised.
            <para>Not all possible combinations are allowed by all drivers. That implies, that an exception
            may be raised for a valid setting of the DataBits property, if the other parameters are not
            valid. Such an example might be that 5-bits are only supported with 2 stop bits and not otherwise.

            <remarks>
            Parity is an error-checking procedure in which the number of 1s must always be the same — either
            even or odd — for each group of bits that is transmitted without error. In modem-to-modem
            communications, parity is often one of the parameters that must be agreed upon by sending parties
            and receiving parties before transmission can take place.

            <remarks>
            Enables handshaking on the serial port. We support three types of handshaking:
            RTS/CTS; XON/XOFF; and DTR/DTS. The Microsoft implementation SerialPort only supports
            RTS/CTS and XON/XOFF.
            <para>This method is not 100% compatible with the Microsoft implementation. By disabling
            RTS flow control, it sets behaviour so that the RTS line is enabled. You must set the
            property RtsEnable as appropriate. Although the Microsoft implementation doesn't support
            DSR/DTR at all, setting this property will also set the DTR line to enabled. You must
            set the property DtrEnable as appropriate.</para>
            <para>When enabling DTR flow control, the DsrSensitivity flag is set, so the driver
            ignores any bytes received, unless the DSR modem input line is high. Otherwise, if DTR
            flow control is disabled, the DSR line is ignored. For more detailed information about
            how windows works with flow control, see the site:
            http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms810467.aspx. When DTR flow control is specified,
            the fOutxDsrFlow is set along with fDsrSensitivity.</para>
            <para>Note, the windows feature RTS_CONTROL_TOGGLE is not supported by this class. This

            On .NET Framework, it wraps around a <see cref="P:RJCP.IO.Ports.Trace.LogSource.TraceSource"/> and provides that to the user. THe method
            <see cref="M:RJCP.IO.Ports.Trace.LogSource.ShouldTrace(System.Diagnostics.TraceEventType)"/> converts enums to integers first so that no boxing is needed.
            <para>On .NET Core, the <see cref="P:RJCP.IO.Ports.Trace.LogSource.TraceSource"/> but doesn't initialize based on a configuration file. This
            means tracing doesn't work. The user can set the <see cref="T:LogSourceFactory.LoggerFactory"/> for a singleton
            object to generate an <see cref="T:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger"/> object. The <see cref="T:RJCP.IO.Ports.Trace.LogSource"/>
